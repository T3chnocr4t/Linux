## Simple Nmap Scripts

Hola! :wave: Let's begin writing a simple Nmap script. Nmap is like a detective tool for computer networks. It helps you discover which devices are connected to a network, what services they're running, and how secure they are.

## Why Nmap🤔?

Nmap is used for network exploration and security auditing. It helps users discover devices on a network, identify open ports, and analyze network security.

## Scripts

Let's proceed 🚀 to explain how the script works. This script is based on Nmap's TCP Connect Scan. I'll also be creating scripts for different types of scans in the future.

First of all, I create a script by opening a text editor and naming the file with the extension ".sh" in this Nmap script. I also give it permission so that I can run it. Additionally, I was able to run it, but in this case, I'm not specifying any IP addresses or port numbers. Now, let me explain how the script works 😄.
